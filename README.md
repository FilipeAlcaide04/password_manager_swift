# 🔐 Password Manager – Swift & Core Data  

This is a **Password Manager app** built using **Swift (Storyboard)** and **Core Data**. The app allows users to securely store and manage their passwords in a simple and user-friendly interface.  

## ✨ Features  
- **Secure password storage** using Core Data  
- **Intuitive UI** designed with Storyboard  
- **Basic CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete)  
- **User authentication (optional, if implemented)**  

## 🎓 About the Project  
I developed this project as part of my **personal study**, building on the **iOS development skills** I learned at university. Through this project, I explored **Swift Storyboard** for an easy start and gained hands-on experience with **Core Data** (something new to me), local storage, and UI design in Swift.
